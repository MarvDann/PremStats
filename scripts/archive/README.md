# Archived Scripts

This directory contains scripts that are no longer actively used but are preserved for reference.

## Files

### Legacy Utility Scripts
- **check-events.js** - Legacy event checking utility
- **complete-prs.js** - GitHub PR completion automation
- **test-enhanced-workflow.js** - Workflow testing script
- **test-github-workflow.js** - GitHub integration testing
- **test-match-detail.html** - HTML test file for match details

## Purpose

These scripts are archived rather than deleted because they may contain:
- Useful code patterns for future development
- Historical approaches to solved problems
- Reference implementations
- Documentation of past workflows

## Usage

These scripts are not guaranteed to work with the current codebase but can be:
- Referenced for implementation patterns
- Used as starting points for new scripts
- Studied for historical context

## Maintenance

- Review archived scripts periodically
- Remove scripts that are no longer relevant
- Update documentation if scripts are reactivated
- Consider moving useful patterns to active scripts
