## üîç Data Corruption Analysis

### Root Cause
The corruption appears to be systematic, affecting specific seasons with a clear pattern:
- **Match data exists** (correct team names, scores, match counts)
- **Dates are corrupted** to 2020 instead of actual season years
- **Seasons affected:** 2002/03, 2015/16, 2017/18-2024/25

### Impact Assessment
- **67.6% of seasons** have reliable data
- **32.4% of seasons** need re-import
- **Corruption is date-only** - team and score data appears intact

## üìà Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Re-import 11 corrupted seasons** from original CSV sources
2. **Verify date parsing** in import scripts to prevent future corruption
3. **Test current season (2024/25)** import process for live data

### Data Import Priority
**High Priority (Recent Seasons):**
- 2023/24, 2024/25 (most recent complete/current seasons)
- 2022/23, 2021/22 (recent seasons for trends)

**Medium Priority (Historical):**
- 2019/20, 2020/21 (COVID-affected seasons)
- 2018/19, 2017/18 (pre-COVID recent seasons)

**Low Priority (Older):**
- 2015/16, 2002/03 (historical seasons)

### Quality Assurance
1. **Implement date validation** in import scripts
2. **Add automated tests** for date ranges per season
3. **Create monitoring** for data corruption detection

## üéâ Success Metrics

**Data Quality Achievement:**
- ‚úÖ 23 seasons with perfect data (1992/93-2016/17 range)
- ‚úÖ No duplicate matches found
- ‚úÖ Correct match counts for all season formats
- ‚úÖ Proper date ranges for uncorrupted seasons

**Coverage:**
- **18 years of reliable historical data** (1992/93-2001/02, 2003/04-2014/15, 2016/17)
- **Complete early Premier League era** (1992/93-2001/02)
