### Development Environment Setup
- **Go**: Installed in ~/go/bin (add to PATH: `export PATH=$HOME/go/bin:$PATH`)
- **pnpm**: Working with workspaces (use `pnpm` not `npm`)
- **Docker Compose v2**: Use `docker compose` not `docker-compose`
- **ESLint**: Standard config (not neostandard due to version conflicts)

## 💡 Key Development Guidelines

### 🎨 Frontend (SolidJS + Tailwind)
- **SolidJS Patterns**: Use proper reactivity patterns, avoid React patterns (#9)
- **Router v0.10.x**: `<Router root={Layout}><Route.../></Router>` structure (#22, #26)
- **Event Handlers**: Type events explicitly - `(e: Event)` or `(e: KeyboardEvent)` (#25)
- **Entry Point**: Use `index.tsx` rather than `App.tsx` (#27)
- **TypeScript JSX**: Configure `jsx: "preserve"` and `jsxImportSource: "solid-js"` (#11)
- **Component Testing**: SolidJS Testing Library + Vitest works excellently (#13)

### 🎨 UI Components & Styling
- **Color Scheme**: Deep purple theme `from-primary to-purple-600`. Avoid green except for football context (#14, #35)
- **StatsCards**: Use `variant="default"` unless indicating success/failure states (#14, #35)
- **Tailwind Variants**: Use `tailwind-variants` for component styling, not manual classes (#10)
- **DataTable Columns**: Must include accessor function - `{ header, key, align, accessor: (item) => item.field }` (#24)
- **Accessibility**: Always include ARIA labels, proper semantic HTML, keyboard navigation (#15)
- **TypeScript Declarations**: Use vite-plugin-dts for UI packages to generate .d.ts files (#23)
- **🎨 Theme System**: Use CSS variables `hsl(var(--variable))` for all colors, never hard-coded values
- **Theme Components**: Import ThemeProvider and ThemeSwitcher from `@premstats/ui` for theme functionality
- **CSS Variable Pattern**: Follow `text-[hsl(var(--foreground))]` and `bg-[hsl(var(--background))]` patterns
- **Theme Testing**: Update component tests to expect CSS variable classes, not hard-coded Tailwind classes
- **🏆 Table Styling**: Use CSS variables for table row colors, not Tailwind opacity modifiers - prevents theme conflicts
- **Color Consistency**: Secondary StatsCard variant matches Europa Conference League table colors for visual harmony

### 🔧 Backend (Go API)
- **Architecture Pattern**: Services → Handlers → Models pattern works excellently (#7)
- **Database Null Handling**: Always use sql.NullString and sql.NullInt32 for nullable fields (#6)
- **Database Relationships**: Use IDs for filtering, not names (e.g., `team_id` vs `team_name`) (#33)
- **API Process Management**: Check running processes first, use `./scripts/dev-restart.sh` (#32)
- **Port Management**: 8081 for API, 3000 for frontend. Check for conflicts (#36)
- **Directory Context**: API commands run from `packages/api/`, project scripts from root (#37)

### 📊 Data Management
- **Import Dependencies**: Squad data must be imported first before goal scorers (#28)
- **Name Normalization**: Critical for linking across data sources ("Mohamed Salah" vs "M. Salah") (#30)
- **Transfer Tracking**: Players need team attribution by season/date for transfers (#31)
- **Duplicate Handling**: Use aggressive name cleaning with diacritic normalization (#34)
- **Data Sources**: OpenFootball Project, API-Football, Football-Data.co.uk (#29)

### 🧪 Testing & Development
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright works excellently with SolidJS, auto-starts dev server (#17)
- **Test Dependencies**: E2E tests require API + Database + UI components all working (#21)
- **UI Build Dependencies**: Frontend depends on UI components being built first (#18)
- **WSL Playwright**: Requires system dependencies `sudo pnpm exec playwright install-deps` (#20)
- **VS Code Launch**: Use `"runtimeExecutable": "bash"` for shell scripts (#16)
- **🧪 Comprehensive Testing**: 122 unit tests, 99 E2E tests, all lint and type checks passing
- **Theme Testing**: Theme system fully tested with E2E tests for switching, persistence, and mobile support
- **Test Commands**: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test:unit`, `pnpm test:e2e` all operational
- **CSS Variable Tests**: Component tests updated to expect CSS variable classes instead of hard-coded Tailwind

### 🛠️ Development Environment
- **Code Style**: 2 spaces, no semicolons, single quotes, no trailing commas (#3)
- **Package Manager**: Use `pnpm` not `npm` with workspaces
- **Docker**: Use `docker compose` not `docker-compose` (v2)
- **ESLint**: Standard config (not neostandard due to version conflicts) (#4)
- **Go Path**: Add ~/go/bin to PATH: `export PATH=$HOME/go/bin:$PATH`
- **WSL Compatibility**: Redis task queues work perfectly, no MCP needed (#1)

### ⚠️ Critical Lessons Learned & Best Practices

#### 🎯 6 Sigma User-Driven Innovations (Critical Issues #40-43)

##### User Feedback: "Let's make sure the date / time of the match is accurate, not just 3pm for everything"
- **Problem**: Previous system assumed 3pm kick-off times for all matches
- **Solution**: Implemented verified historical time preservation - only use authenticated kick-off times
- **Impact**: Eliminated assumptions, achieved 93.8% fixture-based matching success
- **Learning**: User feedback drives breakthrough innovations in data authenticity

##### User Requirement: "I want this report to be a live report so I can view it at any time"
- **Implementation**: Built comprehensive live dashboard with 30-second auto-refresh
- **API Endpoints**: `/api/v1/reports/data-completeness` providing real-time quality metrics
- **Frontend**: SolidJS dashboard with era analysis, quality distribution, and activity logs
- **Result**: Production-ready live monitoring system operational

##### User Guidance: "Don't forget about the robust API restart script"
- **Technical Fix**: Used `scripts/dev/restart-api-robust.sh` for all API management
- **Best Practice**: Single source of truth for API binary, consistent port usage (8081)
- **Reliability**: Eliminated manual restart issues and port conflicts

#### 🕒 Date/Time Handling (Critical Issue #40)
- **NEVER** manipulate timezone offsets manually in date parsing
- **Use UTC date parsing**: `new Date(dateString + ' UTC')` to avoid timezone conversion
- **Example Bug**: `new Date(tempDate.getTime() + tempDate.getTimezoneOffset() * 60000)` converted "August 18" to "August 17"
- **Match Linking**: Date inconsistencies caused 0% match rate, fixed to 85.8% match rate
- **Best Practice**: Always validate date parsing with known test cases before production use

#### 🔧 Regex Patterns in JavaScript Strings (Critical Issue #41)
- **NEVER** use double-escaped regex in JavaScript: `\\d+` becomes literal `\d+` string, not regex
- **Correct**: `/(\d+)/` or `new RegExp('(\\d+)')`
- **Bug Impact**: Caused 100% parsing failure in goal minute extraction
- **Best Practice**: Test regex patterns immediately with simple examples

#### 🚀 API Process Management (Critical Issue #42)
- **NEVER** create multiple API binaries (`api`, `api-new`, etc.) 
- **NEVER** change API port from 8081 without coordinated frontend update
- **Use**: `./scripts/dev/restart-api-robust.sh` for all API management
- **Check processes**: Always verify running processes before starting new ones
- **Best Practice**: Single source of truth for API binary and consistent port usage

#### 📊 Data Import & Validation (Critical Issue #43)
- **Always validate CSV parsing** with known data samples before bulk processing
- **Test player/team linking** on small datasets before production runs
- **Implement progressive debugging**: Start with 1 match, then 10, then 50, then production
- **Match Linking Strategy**: Use teams + date, not CSV IDs for cross-source linking
- **Data Quality**: Verify 80%+ success rates before considering import successful

#### 🎯 Team Attribution Strategy (Critical Issue #44 - Phase 3)
- **NEVER** default all goals to home team - causes massive data skew (97% home goals)
- **Use CSV goal order and timing**: Match goals by minute and player name similarity
- **Implement Levenshtein distance**: For fuzzy player name matching across data sources
- **Validate team balance**: Home/away ratio should be ~1.3:1, not 34:1
- **Best Practice**: Always cross-reference team attribution with original source data

#### 🔍 Coverage Gap Analysis (Critical Issue #45 - Phase 4)
- **Identify high-impact targets first**: 50 high-scoring matches can add 394 goals
- **Use systematic gap analysis**: Seasonal, team, and temporal coverage patterns
- **Implement priority-based imports**: Focus on matches with highest goal potential
- **Data source validation**: Not all data sources cover all time periods consistently
- **Best Practice**: Analyze gaps before attempting data imports to maximize efficiency

#### 🏗️ Data Quality Framework (Critical Issue #46 - Phases 1-4)
- **Implement comprehensive validation**: Score consistency, team attribution, duplicates
- **Use progressive improvement**: 7.9% → 24.3% score consistency through systematic fixes
- **Build reusable validation tools**: Automated checks prevent regression
- **Track metrics continuously**: Coverage %, consistency %, attribution rates
- **Best Practice**: Validate after every major data operation to catch issues early

### 🎯 UI Patterns
- **Pagination**: 50 items per page, include total count, reset to page 1 on filter change (#38)
- **Team Filters**: Use team dropdown with ID values but display names, filter by `current_team_id` (#39)
- **Storybook**: Use `@storybook/html-vite` with `vite-plugin-solid` (#12)

### Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Start services
docker compose up -d postgres redis

# Start API (in packages/api)
export PATH=$HOME/go/bin:$PATH && go run cmd/api/main.go
# OR use built binary: PORT=8081 ./bin/api

## Troubleshooting

### Port Conflicts
If ports are already in use:
```bash
# Change ports in docker-compose.yml
# Or stop conflicting services
lsof -i :3000
kill -9 <PID>
```

### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Reset database
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up postgres -d
docker-compose exec api go run ./cmd/migrate up
```

### Build Failures
```bash
# Clear caches
pnpm store prune
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

- ✅ **Navigation works correctly** - All routes and page transitions
- ✅ **Mobile navigation works** - Responsive mobile menu functionality
- ✅ **Teams page loads and functions** - Team list, search, filtering
- ✅ **Players page loads with content** - Player stats and data tables
- ✅ **Matches page loads with filters** - Season/limit filters and results
- ✅ **Statistics page loads with league table** - Standings and position legends
- ✅ **Error handling** - Graceful degradation for API failures
- ✅ **Responsive design** - Multiple screen sizes and viewports
- ✅ **Loading states** - Progress indicators during API calls

#### Team Detail Tests (`team-detail.spec.ts`)
- ✅ **Team detail navigation** - From teams list to individual team pages
- ✅ **Back button functionality** - Proper navigation history
- ✅ **Invalid team ID handling** - 404 error states and recovery

#### API Integration Tests (`api-integration.spec.ts`)
- ✅ **API health checks** - Backend connectivity verification
- ✅ **Teams API integration** - Frontend ↔ Backend communication
- ✅ **Seasons API integration** - Dropdown population and filtering
- ✅ **Error handling** - API failure graceful degradation
- ✅ **Timeout handling** - Network timeout scenarios
- ✅ **CORS configuration** - Cross-origin request compatibility

### Browser Coverage
- **Desktop**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- **Mobile**: Chrome on Android, Safari on iOS
- **Responsive**: 320px to 1920px viewport testing

### Running E2E Tests

#### Command Line
```bash
# Run all E2E tests (headless)
pnpm test:e2e

# Run with visual UI test runner
pnpm test:e2e:ui

# Run with visible browser (headed mode)
pnpm test:e2e:headed

# View HTML test report
pnpm test:e2e:report
```

#### VS Code Tasks
Use `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Tasks: Run Task":
- **🎭 Run E2E Tests** - All tests headless
- **🎭 Run E2E Tests (UI Mode)** - Visual test runner
- **🎭 Run E2E Tests (Headed)** - Visible browser mode
- **📊 View E2E Test Report** - HTML report viewer

### Test Environment Requirements
1. **API Server**: localhost:8081 (auto-started by test runner)
2. **Database**: PostgreSQL + Redis (Docker)
3. **UI Components**: Built in packages/ui/dist
4. **System Dependencies**: `sudo pnpm exec playwright install-deps` (WSL)

### Automated Test Runner
The `scripts/run-e2e-tests.sh` script automatically:
- ✅ Checks API health (starts if needed)
- ✅ Verifies Docker services (starts if needed)
- ✅ Ensures UI components are built
- ✅ Installs Playwright browsers
- ✅ Runs tests in specified mode
- ✅ Generates HTML reports

### Test Configuration
- **Base URL**: http://localhost:3000
- **Auto-start**: Development server launches automatically
- **Screenshots**: Captured on failure
- **Videos**: Retained on failure
- **Traces**: Available on retry
- **Retry**: 2 attempts for flaky tests

### WSL Environment Notes
WSL users need to install system dependencies:
```bash
sudo pnpm exec playwright install-deps
```

Alternative manual install:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libnspr4 libnss3 libasound2
```

### Test Reliability
- **Service Dependencies**: Tests wait for API + Database readiness
- **UI Dependencies**: Verifies component builds before testing
- **Network Resilience**: Handles API timeouts and failures
- **Data Consistency**: Tests work with varying data states
- **Browser Compatibility**: Cross-browser testing prevents regressions

The E2E testing framework ensures PremStats works reliably across all supported browsers and devices!
